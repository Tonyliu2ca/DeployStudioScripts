To use this script, you must do the following:
1.  Run setupDeployStudioAuthorization.py to generate a DeployStudioAuthorization file
2.  Place 'DeployStudioAuthorization' in the root of your DeployStudio repository
3.  Add the prestageInfo.py script to DeployStudio.


Thanks to tvsutton for the setupDeployStudioAuthorization.py script and the overall method for doing this
